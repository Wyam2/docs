Title: Command Line
Description: Describes how to run Wyam from the command line and the available options.
Order: 2
RedirectFrom: getting-started/usage
---
To execute Wyam you need to run either `wyam` (if you installed it as a global tool) or `dotnet /path/to/wyam/Wyam.dll` (if you downloaded the ZIP archive) followed by any Wyam arguments. If you don't specify any arguments, the root folder will be set to the current folder and if a file named `config.wyam` is found, it will be used as the configuration file. You can also specify a root folder that's different than the current folder after the `wyam` command. For example:

```
wyam
```

Or:

```
wyam C:\MySite
```

There are several different available commands (use `--help` or `-?` to see them):

```
>wyam --help            

usage:  <command> [<args>]                                                
                                                                          
    build      Runs the build process (this is the default command).      
    new        Scaffolds the given recipe into a specified path.          
    preview    Runs the preview server without generating anything.       
    help       Displays various help messages.                            
```

Each command has its own set of options. The main command that gets executed
by default is `build` which builds the site given the options you specify:

```
>wyam build --help

usage:  build [-v] [--attach] [-w] [-p [arg]] [--force-ext]

    -v, --version <arg>      Specifies the version range of the package
                             to use.
    -l, --latest             Specifies that the latest available version
                             of the package should be used (this will
                             always trigger a request to the sources).
    -s, --source <arg>...    Specifies the package source(s) to get the
                             package from.
    -e, --exclusive          Indicates that only the specified package
                             source(s) should be used to find the
                             package.
    <package>                The package to install.

--recipe usage:

    -i, --ignore-known-packages    Ignores (does not add) packages for
                                   known recipes.
    <recipe>                       The recipe to use.

# Nested Arguments

Note that some of the arguments such as `--nuget` are "nested" and must be contained in quotes if they contain options of their own (and any inner quotes must be escaped). For example, the following command will load a Nuget package named `Foo.Bar`:

```
wyam --nuget Foo.Bar 
```

However, if you want to specify any additional options for the `--nuget` option such as to accept pre-release packages, you need to surround the whole value in quotes:

```
wyam --nuget "Foo.Bar -p" 
```

# Embedded Web server

Wyam includes an embedded web server you can use to test your site locally. It includes support for ignoring file extensions and implicitly delivering a `index.html` page if one exists. This is similar to the convention a lot of static site hosts such as GitHub Pages uses.

To activate the preview server, use the `-p` or `--preview` argument. This will make the site available on a URL like `http://localhost:5080`. If you prefer a different port, add that after the preview argument. This will cause the Wyam process to remain open in your console until you hit a key to exit.

You can change where the preview server pulls files from with the `--preview-root` argument.

You can serve files under a virtual directory with the `--virtual-dir` option. This will make all of files on disk appear as if they were under the specified path on the web server. Requesting any resources or pages outside of this virtual directory will result in 404 Not Found errors.

# File Watching

You can turn on file watching with the `-w` or `--watch` argument. When file watching is enabled, the generation will be re-run any time a file in one of the input folders changes. Some modules can cache information from one generation to the next, so re-generations after a watched file changes should be somewhat faster. Note that because Wyam makes no assumptions about dependencies between files, modules, and pipelines, it is not possible to only regenerate the effects of the file that changed. We don't know what modules that file may have impacted indirectly and therefore need to regenerate everything (it's possible that in the future this could get smarter, but it's a very hard problem). Also note that some modules like [Less](/modules/less) may not reflect changes to their underlying files due to the mechanics of the module.

# LiveReload

> Requires Wyam 0.17.0 or greater.

Wyam comes with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) support built-in and it is automatically enabled when the preview server is used while file watching. LiveReload works by injecting JavaScript into HTML pages when served using the embedded preview server, no changes to your content need to be made. When any input files are re-generated, Wyam will refresh all connected browsers automagically.

The LiveReload server listens on port `35729` by default. When using LiveReload in conjunction with the preview server, ensure that any relevant HTML files have a closing `<body/>` tag as this is required for `<script>` injection.

# Paths

The paths that Wyam uses can be specified on the command line. This includes the input path(s) specified by `--input` where Wyam will look for files, the output path specified by `--output` where Wyam will place the output of modules like [WriteFiles](/modules/writefiles), the config file path specified by `--config` where Wyam will look for a configuration file, and the root path specified as the final argument that Wyam considers the base path for all other relative paths. By default, the root path is set to the path from where Wyam is executed. You may want to specify a different base path (for example, if running from a build script or as part of a larger process). In this case, just supply an alternate absolute path at the end of the command line. This new root path will be the base for all other relative paths including input and output paths. This is a good way to ensure consistency regardless of which path Wyam is run from.

Note that these paths can also be specified from within [your configuration script](/docs/usage/configuration). From there you can set [`FileSystem.OutputPath`](/api/Wyam.Common.IO/IFileSystem/6DB77CDF), [`FileSystem.RootPath`](/api/Wyam.Common.IO/IFileSystem/3D1098EC), or call [`FileSystem.InputPaths.Add()`](/api/Wyam.Common.IO/IFileSystem/540AF0EB).

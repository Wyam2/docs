This theme contains the bare minimum files and code to work with the blog recipe. It can be used as the basis for new themes or as a starting point for your own custom layout. Typically you'd copy all of the files from the source repository into your own `input` or `theme` directory and then edit them (as opposed to using the theme as a theme like you would with others).
